# Smart Resume Analysis: Ranking by Skills and Structure

## Project Overview
The Smart Resume Analysis tool is an NLP-based application designed to automate the screening and ranking of resumes. It evaluates resumes based on skill extraction, formatting standards, and overall document organization. The tool utilizes Python libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and SkillNER to extract and evaluate key data, ranking resumes according to job-specific keywords and structure quality. This automated ranking assists HR professionals in finding the most suitable candidates by saving time and improving the accuracy of resume evaluations.
